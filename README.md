# GameCollection
A lightweight application that lets users track games they have played along with their associated genres, a small description, rating and played status.

# How to use
This is a Visual Studio project so you will need to open this repo in Visual Studio. I plan on adding an exe soon but until then you just have to build the project in Studio every time you need to run it.
